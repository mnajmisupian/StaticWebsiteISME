                            Beginning of the enrollment session, remind consumers of the complete procedure. It is crucial to explicitly remind them of the usual timeframe to complete the proofing and enrollment phase. Usability considerations include

Users should be given the option to opt in or out of a partial identity proofing session.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Set user expectations for how the enrollment session will go because prior identity verification experiences may have an impact on them.

                            KBV (Knowledge based verification) should not be utilised because it has severe usability issues. Given the limitations of human memory, KBV is frequently prone to errors. If utilised, take into account the following usability factors.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Users should be made aware at the outset of the enrollment session that they cannot leave and that their activities must remain visible at all times.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Give users explicit guidance on how to complete the collection process when biometrics are gathered during the enrolling session.
                            </li>

                        <p>
                            Since remote identity proofing is conducted online, follow general web usability principles. For example:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Create a user interface that guides people through the application process.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Lessen the memory load on users.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Create a unified interface.

                            <li>
                                Label each stage in a sequence clearly.
