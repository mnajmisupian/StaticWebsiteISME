                The purpose is to raise implementers’ awareness of the usability considerations associated with enrollment and identity proofing. The goal is to promote a smooth, positive enrollment process for users by minimising user burden and enrollment friction.

                            Beginning of the enrollment session, remind consumers of the complete procedure. It is crucial to explicitly remind them of the usual timeframe to complete the proofing and enrollment phase. Usability considerations include

                            <li>
                                Provide users with information on what data will be deleted, what will be kept for follow-up sessions in the future and what form of identification they need to present to complete a session in the future. Users should be given the option to opt in or out of a partial identity proofing session.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Set user expectations for how the enrollment session will go because prior identity verification experiences may have an impact on them.

                            <li>

                                Inform CSPs (Credential Service Providers) that requesting extra attributes or usage of the user's attributes may be unexpected or cause users discomfort if they are requested for any reason other than the required information.

                            KBV (Knowledge based verification) should not be utilised because it has severe usability issues. Given the limitations of human memory, KBV is frequently prone to errors. If utilised, take into account the following usability factors.

                            <li>

                                If only partially completed, advise users of the following: what information will be deleted; what information, if any, will be kept for follow-up sessions; how long the information will be kept; and what form of identification they will need to bring to a subsequent session.
                            </li>

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Users should be made aware at the outset of the enrollment session that they cannot leave and that their activities must remain visible at all times.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Give users explicit guidance on how to complete the collection process when biometrics are gathered during the enrolling session.
                            </li>

                        <p>
                            Since remote identity proofing is conducted online, follow general web usability principles. For example:

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Create a user interface that guides people through the application process.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Lessen the memory load on users.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Create a unified interface.

                            <li>
                                Label each stage in a sequence clearly.
